# Carousel Craft Deployment Summary

## Overview

We've successfully deployed the Carousel Craft application with Supabase Edge Functions for AI-powered image generation. This document summarizes the key components and changes made.

## Edge Function

The `generate-images` Edge Function is now deployed and configured to:

- Process job requests from the frontend
- Generate prompts using GPT-4o
- Create images using GPT-image-1
- Update job status in the Supabase database
- Store prompts and images for later retrieval

## Database Setup

We've confirmed that the necessary tables are created in Supabase:

1. `jobs` - Tracks carousel generation jobs
2. `carousel_prompts` - Stores AI-generated prompts
3. `carousel_images` - Stores generated images with metadata
4. `templates` - Stores carousel templates and configurations

## Frontend Integration

The frontend application has been updated to:

1. Create and store jobs in the Supabase database
2. Call the Edge Function to process jobs
3. Poll for job status updates
4. Display real-time progress to users
5. Show generated images and prompts in the UI
6. Allow browsing of generated content in the Library

## Workflow

The end-to-end workflow now consists of:

1. User creates a job with template and data input
2. The job is saved to the database
3. The Edge Function is triggered to process the job
4. The function generates prompts using GPT-4o
5. For each prompt, GPT-image-1 creates an image
6. Images and prompts are stored in the database
7. Job status is updated throughout the process
8. Frontend polls for updates and displays progress
9. User can view all generated content in the Library

## Next Steps

To complete the deployment:

1. Ensure the OpenAI API key is set in Supabase secrets
2. Deploy the frontend application to a hosting service
3. Test the end-to-end workflow with a sample job
4. Monitor usage and performance

This implementation provides a scalable, efficient way to generate thousands of image-based carousels with a user-friendly interface.
